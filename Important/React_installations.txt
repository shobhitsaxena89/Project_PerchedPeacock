**************************************************************


there are 3 types of classes that support views : component, directives, pipes
using @component decorator we can provide additional metadata to explain how to instantiate and use component at runtime
The components are used to provide data to view via process known as data binding. The DoM elements are bind to the component properties
A component must belong to an NgModule in order for it to be usable by another component or application. To specify that a component is a member of an NgModule, you should list it in the declarations property of that NgModule.
